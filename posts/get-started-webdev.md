## Hi in this Article We will Discuss how to get started in Web development (Frontend) and How To be Good at it

First of all Web dev doesn't need a computer science certificate or some other random certificates

**by the way having a computer science certificate is nice and will help you to understand things deeply**

So what you need is just a desire and love to learn new things every day because we literally see new technologies every day

Finally, this is a list of how to be a beginner web developer

- HTML
- CSS
- javascript

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.
Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) stands for (Cascading Style Sheets) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript)

## So What's Next?

After You learned About js And Vannila js and know How DOM (Document Object Model) and Working With Some Web Apis

After doing all that stuff. You need To pick a javascript framework

By the Way, there are a lot of javascript frameworks out there but I Suggest you pick one of these

1. React
2. Angular
3. Vue

**By the way React is a Library, But it is the most used for Production builds**

if you don't know what's best just go for React because it is The most popular. And Then go for another framework

## What's Next?

After you finished all that stuff. Go to Learn Testing

In Testing We have 3 Types of testing:

- Unit Testing ( for components Testing )
- End To end Testing ( Test All You application as a real User )

For unit testing, I suggest going for **Jest**
For End To End Testing, I suggest going For **Cypress**

**Congratulation Now You are a beginner web Developer**
